## [0.0.6]

This version mainly focuses on getting the build system into a usable state.
There weren't any changes to how texstyle itself works, but the makefile and install process have been completely redone. I won't go into the details in this changelog. I'll leave that to the documentation.

## [0.0.4d2]

### bugfixes

### additions

+ added new `envRefreshLevel` option which sets at what level the numbering on
  the theorems, propositions, etc. refresh.

### removals

### changes

+ **major change**: the class `texstyle-article` is now called `texstyle-notes`.
  any document using the `texstyle-article` class will need to change the
  document class to reflect this.
  this change was made due to how divorced `texstyle-article` became from the
  stock `article` class.
  in the future, a slimmer article class will be made as a replacement.

+ now using `kvoptions` to process package options.

## [0.0.3d2]

### Bugfixes

+ Temporary fix for an issue with the font becoming white on a page split in
  theorem environments.

## [0.0.3d2]

### Additions

+ Now able to use `hyperref`'s `autoref` macro to reference theorems with
  correct labelling.
  For this to work, `hyperref` must either be loaded before `TeXStyle` or loaded
  afterwards with a `useHyperrefMacros` option passed to TeXStyle.
  *(Partially Document)*
+ Changed load order of TeXStyle-article to reflect above changes.
  

### Changes

* Now using `amssymb`, `amsmath` and `centernot` instead of `fdsymbol` as the
  math font. *(Documented)*
+ Upped minor version number
